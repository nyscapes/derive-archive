Jean-Michel Basquiat recently made waves in the American art community and wider society approximately half a year ago when his painting set a record high for US artists at auction. However, despite this recent re-entry into the public consciousness, individuals familiar with New York and the city’s culture and close ties to people and places know of the important connection to Basquiat. The film directed by Edo Bertoglio manages to effectively capture this intimate connection through a narrative that not only effectively shows Basquiat’s connection to the city but also manages to highlight the various manifestations of the city’s culture during the time of filming. These different segments are represented by the various people that Basquiat meets around the city while attempting to sell his artwork, including the one represented by himself while he walks around striving to make ends meet. In a majority of other mediums, and even in film itself, the extent with which Bertoglio is willing to bring together the rock, Carribean music, and funk performances would create an extremely chaotic piece that has no cohesiveness. However, when viewed as an exploration of New York in the 80s, which was when the film was shot despite its later release date, one begins to understand what the work is attempting to highlight.
Interestingly, the different encounters that take place during the film take on many similar characteristics of the derive experience, alluding to a slow meandering way of travelling with no planning, but instead an entire journey driven by a combination of mere happenstance and the natural ebbs and flows of the city’s culture and its effect on geography. The voice-over that runs throughout the film often matches the monologue that accompanies the observations and notes that I take down during my own experience, or at least the report that I do when reflecting on the things I saw and observed during the walk. It deviates from traditional films that we have come to expect because of this very characteristic, but instead provides an experience that manages to tie the past two derives we have completed into a culture that we did not necessarily have access to. Furthermore, the almost-jarring and discordant combination of different musical performances, interspersed with the other scenes of Basquiat making his way through the city, help recreate the various zones of influence and impact that derives are meant to expose. The different emerging aspects of culture, those which are currently dominant, and the few that are undergoing the process of fading away completely, are all touched upon in the film. Furthermore, the Basquiat’s experience in the film is an attempt to show how the hustle and bustle of the city causes these zones of influence to ebb and flow into one another, with the different encounters showcasing the way in which these interact amongst themselves. Ultimately, the film provides an interesting insight into the various lessons about the city in the 80s, using the media that individuals listened to at the time, presented in a medium that does not traditionally showcase these interactions.
