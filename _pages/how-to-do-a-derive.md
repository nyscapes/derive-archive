## Theory

* Read the two Debord articles, “[Theory of the
  Dérive](http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/theory.html)” and “[Introduction
  to a Critique of Urban
  Geography](http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/presitu/geography.html).” They
  are short. Get them in your heads.
* Reflect on the readings we have done for class so far. Have it in your
  heads, too.

## Practice

### Setup

* Check out [the first dérive map]({{ site.baseurl }}/first-derive-map) and find your starting point. If it’s in
  the middle of a building, move your point to the street.
* Print a [Field Papers
  Atlas](http://fieldpapers.org/compose#14/40.7220/-73.9924) of the area, more
  or less, that you’ll be walking in. You’ll need to turn in this paper atlas
  on the dérive due date.
* Install the [Derive App](http://deriveapp.com/s/v2/) on your phone.

### Day of

* Get to your starting point as indicated on the map.
* Turn off notifications, etc., on your phone.
* Put your headphones in your bag.
* Fire up the Derive App and start a new dérive. Follow the instructions it
  gives you
* Notice what’s going on around you as well as inside you (like, your
  thoughts). Keep in mind the theory you read.
* Take notes on your map, keeping track of where you’re walking.
* Take general textual notes, too, though, again, about what you’re thinking
  and what you’re feeling/sensing (seeing, hearing, tasting, etc.)
* Every few minutes, the app will let you pick a new card. Choose it, or keep
  following your current card until you think you’ve “finished” the task.
* Keep this up for a while (an hour at least), until you think you’ve reached
  a point where you have a sense of the mediascape you’ve walked through.
* A the end of the dérive, you should have, at the very least, your _paper_
  Field Papers Atlas marked with your path and handwritten notes about your
  dérive.
  
### Making the Report

* Clone the Dérive Archive project (clone url:
  `https://github.com/nyscapes/derive-archive.git` ).
* Compile your notes and any photos, videos, or audio files you’ve recorded
  during the dérive together, and draft a markdown post in Atom. Include your name in
  the file name for the dérive, like “2018-02-03-moacir-first-derive.md.”
* Follow the directions on the [how to post your dérive report]({{ site.baseurl
  }}/how-to-post-your-derive-report) to learn how to collect the
  various points where your path goes in making the online map.
* Include that path metadata in your dérive (the map won’t show in Markdown
  Preview in Atom).
* Pull from GitHub.
* Save, stage, commit, push.
* Check out how your dérive looks.
