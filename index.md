Welcome to the Blog for the spring 2018 instance of the “Media History of NY”
course as offered by the [Department of Media, Culture, and
Communication](http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/mcc/) at NYU. This instance is being
taught by [Moacir P. de Sá Pereira](http://moacir.com), from the [Department
of English](http://as.nyu.edu/english.html). 

This course has a [website with a
syllabus](http://moacir.com/courses-nyu/media-history-of-nyc), and over the
course of the semester, students will be posting their thoughts about the
course here while also collaborating to build the web project “[Downtown
Archæologies](http://nyscapes.github.io/downtown-archaeologies),” based on a
media history of Downtown New York.
