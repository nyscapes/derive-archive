Welcome to the Dérive Archive, an archive of
[dérives](http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/theory.html) undertaken in New
York City (and perhaps elsewhere). We begin with the dérives taken in the
spring 2018 instance of the “Media History of NY” course as offered by the
[Department of Media, Culture, and
Communication](http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/mcc/) at NYU. This instance is being
taught by [Moacir P. de Sá Pereira](http://moacir.com), from the [Department
of English](http://as.nyu.edu/english.html).
