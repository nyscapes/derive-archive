title: How to Post to this Blog

Hopefully, by the time you read this post, you’ll already be familiar with
[Atom](http://atom.io), Git, and [GitHub](http://github.com). You’ll also have
a GitHub account, you’ll be added to the [NewYorkScapes GitHub
group](http://github.com/nyscapes), and you’ll have posting privileges to this
blog.

As you know, Git works with *projects* or *repositories*, not with single
files. This blog, then, is such a project, made up of many smaller files that
get mixed together to make what you see in your browser. Your task, in order
to write a post, then, is simple:

1.  you will create a file
1.  you will fill the file with your thoughts
1.  you will add the file to the project by saving-staging-committing-pushing

I hope the middle step is the hardest. The rest of this post will detail the
other two steps…

### Creating a file

All of the blog posts for this blog live as individual files inside the
`_posts` folder in this project. You should see it in Atom.
