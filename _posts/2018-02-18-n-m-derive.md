I honestly can’t remember the last time I walked, unencumbered, around the city, just for the sake of exploring. Usually, I am listening to headphones, talking with friends, or traveling with a set destination in  mind. This Derive truly gave me the opportunity to spend time alone with New York, and what I discovered and saw was very interesting.

My Derive started on the corner of Tompkins Square Park, at the junction of East 10th St and Avenue B. The park was quiet yet active on the bright Saturday morning that I visited, but I didn’t stay in that area for long. Using the Derive app, I found myself walking towards Avenue C, and the outskirts of the city. As I strolled down East 10th St, away from the park, I was struck by how silent it was. Usually, when walking in the city, I am bombarded with sirens, horns, and the sounds of idle chatter around me. However, this area of the city was completely quiet, so much so, that I could hear the leaves rustle down the street in the wind. Once I got to Avenue C, I saw my first of many murals. One of the things that stood out to me most on my Derive was how many detailed murals and wall paintings I saw. The first mural had a picture of Gil Scott-Heron, emblazoned with the words “The Revolution Will Not Be Televised.” Next to him, detailed depictions of many inspirational and famous black women, including Mae Carol Jamison, and Dominique Dawes. In fact, throughout the day, I lost count of how many murals I saw, but each one of them (mostly in the depths of the East Village) were colorful, expressive, and related to African American culture. Seeing the murals reminded me of something Luc Sante said, that “taller edifices would present blank surfaces on their sides…they were let out as signboards, the signs being painted directly onto the brick” (57). I wonder if mural painting arose from the decorated sides of the buildings. Did murals become popularized recently, or during the 19th century? I think it is interesting to draw a connection between today’s tradition of murals and wall painting, and the city’s past history of decorating buildings.

My walk took me through Alphabet City and then on to 1st and 2 avenue. The contrast between the two areas was stark. There were barely any people walking on Avenue C, which was wider and less cluttered than the other avenues. There were a few pedestrians with grocery bags, and occasional cars passing on the street, but the area felt much more residential than any other part of the city. There were also multiple gardens in this area, lending to to the residential feel. However, these gardens were locked up for the winter, and full of trash and debris. Meanwhile, the area past Avenue A, closer to East 7th and 8th, was bustling with the activity and noise of people getting brunch and stopping by expensive coffee shops.

Sante mentions how, years ago, First Avenue through Third Avenue were considered areas for the “respectable poor” (15). Indeed, one of my favorite classic novels, “Washington Square,” by Henry James, touches upon this theme. In the book, one of the characters, Dr. Ausin Sloper, visits another, poorer, character at her house on Second Avenue, and remarks how put together and clean the house is, for being on Second Avenue. While there are still some parts of this section that are a bit run down today, these few blocks have been taken over by hipster coffee shops, expensive restaurants, and vintage clothing stores.

Sante also claims that “Neighborhood stability has always been something of a chimera in Manhattan’s history…the only constants that obtained were: (1) improvements in status and income spurred people to leave their neighborhoods…. and (2) within Manhattan, the motion was always northward” (20). I would like to amend that statement. Currently, I think that the wealthy, middle, and upper-middle classes move upwards and outwards. Living downtown, in the Soho, East Village, and West Village areas has become increasingly fashionable, and as a result rent prices have soared while pricy establishments have opened up where there were once bars and ethnic restaurants. Now, the  numbered avenues, as well as the beginning of Alphabet City, have become somewhat gentrified, while the depths of Alphabet City, closer to FDR drive, are home to housing projects and power plants. However, while walking, I noticed multiple construction projects on Avenue A and B, erecting new, modern buildings. If everything in New York City is a cycle, and areas are constantly growing into and out of their labels, will the outward push of gentrification continue?

However, the development and changing of areas is not always a bad thing. As Shannon Mattern says in “Deep Mapping the City,” “urban environments everywhere are characterized by  a lot of messy materiality…cities themselves serve to mediate between these various manifestations of intelligence. and to bring the ‘old’ and the ‘new’… together in close contact” (156). While walking on Second Avenue, I noticed a large, white, and ornate church, nestled between two apartment buildings and a restaurant. The restaurant was abuzz with young people, eating and drinking next to a reformed protestant church that was erected in 1891. All around the East Village, small, brick apartments stood next to buildings with beautiful detailing and decorations. As Sante mentioned, the middle classes hired others to decorate their homes to model the tastes of the upper classes, giving off the airs of wealth (56). Because of this, the city is a hodgepodge of different styles, lined up next to each other. It was really fascinating to see, especially after having read about it. I never really stopped to notice the detailing on buildings before, but now I find myself appreciating it more.

One of the most interesting things I came across on my walk was a Russian and Turkish Bath House on 10th St, that still had an old-style sign out front. It was fascinating seeing an old establishment, the likes of which are mostly extinct, nestled into the city! Seeing that bath house allowed me to picture what it might have been like in the early 20th century, when men of the area visited the house to socialize. If, as Mattern says, the city is truly a compilation of layers and histories, those levels were on full display at the bath house, an old establishment that has surely modernized with technology and wiring on the inside, all of which is layered on top of the history of the building.

However, this exhibit in historical archeology once again relates back to issues of gentrification. I googled the bath house after my Derive, out of sheer curiosity, and found a recent New York Times article, which lamented that, “the fabled baths…have been claimed by the denizens of new New York, as shvitzing has joined shuffleboard, brewing beer and pickling as a pastime enjoyed by millennials” (Correal). Much like vinyl records, yuppies and hipsters have latched on to bath houses as a new phenomenon taken from the past. Still, it is interesting, as the article details how control of the bath house is split between Boris, one of the original owners, and David, the son of another owner. Each of the owners has their own weeks to control the house. Boris draws in the old, classic eccentric Jewish crowd by keeping the bath house the way it has always been, while David uses groupons and online reservations to bring the establishment into the 21st century. This is a true example of the complex layering and interaction between the new and old, that can only be seen in New York.

This Derive was truly an experiment in engaging with the city. While walking, I became acutely aware of the silence of certain areas, and of the ruckus of others. I picked up on the smell of baking garlic bread as I walked down East 10th Street, and made note of all the restaurants I passed. I saw new and old buildings meshed together, sandwiched on crowded roads. Most of all, I realized how truly unique New York City is, in its ability to continually re-invent and rebuild itself, from one generation to the next.
