When thinking about this derive, I was curious as to how it would go. Being lost in a city that I’ve adapted to seemed like a huge challenge—carrying a map around sounded absurd.
My starting point was on Delancey Street, a bustling and hectic street in the Lower East Side. I remembered it as one of my least favorite spots,
particularly as I interned down there and was constantly biking around it in the sweltering summer heat. The area was loud and dirty, cars racing past, and stylish, young
professionals walking around. Lucky enough, I picked a warm and breezy Sunday afternoon to take my derive, and the streets were full of people taking advantage of the weather.

My first card told me to look for something yellow, and the first thing I saw was a yellow traffic sign. I walked westward on Delancey, until my card told me to take a right.
Once I turned onto Clinton Street, the atmosphere completely changed. This narrow street was jam packed with people strolling in and out of restaurants. Ivan Ramen, one of my
favorites, had a line out the door and was spilling onto the streets. This street, alone, seemed like an entirely different community than the one I previously experienced with
headphones in my ears or in discussion with a friend. I paid more attention to the vast majority of groups on their phones, in their own conversations, ignoring the energy of a
single street. A clue given to me during this moment of my derive asked me to listen in on a conversation, something that freaked me out, but something that everyone does in
New York. With so many people shouting on the street, it’s quite easy to overhear what people say. A young couple was arguing over whether or not to wait for ramen, I smiled
to myself, and kept walking up. On the corner rests the mecca of long breakfast lines and blueberry pancakes: Clinton Street Bakery. It was bathed in sunlight, resting
below a brick building with detailed features and rounded windows.

Once I turned onto E Houston Street, the chaotic energy picked up once again. I never noticed before how streets can act as barriers, enclosing different atmospheres and communities.
Delancey and E Houston seem to provide this barrier, as I immediately was thrown back into a busy street full of people fighting over sidewalk space. Along with the sidewalk, I was
shocked by how much construction was going on in this area. Scaffolding lined the blocks, and the wide walkways were shielded from the sun. My Derive app moved me back and forth
 alongside Stanton Street, turning back into a narrow street with little restaurants and cafes. It was a strong mix of bodegas and hipster cafés with open windows.

What shocked me the most in this area was the amount of high schools and elementary schools. New York public schools, in my neighborhood, have a distinct look to them: most city
schools do. However, the schools located in the Lower East Side felt out of place. They had large, open courtyards and fencing. It was almost similar to my own high school back home.
It sat in the shade, its walls covered in murals, and had the vibe of a suburban high school. Even the elementary school down a block had a small enclosed playground and drawings
taped to the door. The street seemed quite, almost peaceful. I wondered if that had to do with the nature of the area itself, or solely because there were so many schools, thus
children, nearby.

Throughout this first half of my derive, I noticed how much the Lower East Side is a pastiche of different communities. There are the young professionals and hip crowds sitting at
brunch spots and coffee shops. There are the families and kids in the parks and playgrounds, mothers pushing strollers down the streets. There’s a sense of dirt and grunge, as
tiny mom and pop stores were mixed alongside gourmet eateries. The variety of languages within this space interested me as well. Signs for schools were in Chinese, Hebrew,
and Spanish.

Graffiti covered unused buildings and brick walls, while piles of trash lay rotting on the ground. None of this had any effect on the atmosphere of the area.

It seemed like the perfect mix of grime and art. Sante mentions within “Low Life” the sheer number of signage on streets. He perfectly captured this by stating it as “a riot of texts,
a forest of signs” (Sante 55). How do we decide where to look, when every surface is covered?

As I turned onto Allen, I headed up Second Avenue. I never realized how wide second avenue was before this, as it fits four entire lanes. My phone, unfortunately, died at this
point, but I remember laughing to myself about how many brunch a-frame signs that lined the street. On each block, there were at least 3 signs promising the best brunch deal or
bottomless mimosa in the city. If there’s one thing that you can learn about New Yorkers from, it’s the endless witty signs and chalkboards that line our streets. My final
move was to follow something green, and I followed a man carrying a green tote bag (another card that slightly creeped me out). Once I turned onto Seventh Street, I was shocked
by how beautiful and quiet this street was. I live extremely close, and am in this neighborhood quite often, but have never appreciated its beauty. Most of the stores were closed,
as it was Sunday, but groups of people quietly walked on the sidewalks. The avenues were bustling, but this side street seemed exempt from that. It was interesting how the volume
of people’s voices and calm of seventh street on this Sunday transformed this single street into a calm atmosphere.

When I finished the derive, I couldn’t help but to think of Mattern’s “Deep Mapping the Media City” and its notion that deep mapping is the most accurate way to map a city. Prior to
 this experience, a single map did the trick. Yet, how can we map a city and fully understand it if we can’t see, smell, hear, taste the pieces of it? She states that “today’s urban
 form is perhaps best expressed not through a two-dimensional map, but via the remixed I-Pod playlist, the database  documentary, and a live feed of data” (Mattern 30). If we’re
 going to truly map out a city, we need to take the time to pay attention to what being in a city actually feels and looks like, rather than solely its layout.
