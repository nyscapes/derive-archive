For my second derive, my starting point was on Gansevoort St between Washington and Greenwich streets. This puts me in the meatpacking district to start, an area layered with expensive boutiques, famous restaurants, and tall glitzy hotels. There is construction being done on Gansevoort, so sounds of drilling echo through the crisp morning. I watch as construction workers chat and laugh. It is a chilly but nice day.

I feel like I came to visit this area frequently when I would take trips to New York City as a kid but I don’t as much now that I live here. As I begin, it is interesting to think about how this area has been rebuilt and gentrified. What were once slaughterhouses and packing plants have been taken over by large businesses who capitalize on the large spaces and open layouts. In the summer, people head to the rooftops in the area to take in views of the Hudson and the city while drinking overpriced cocktails. As I walk, I think about the ways in which the mood of the city changes with the season. The weather has been so back and forth this year that it seems like people get confused how to respond. But as the days get longer, people seem to interact with the city around them more and more.

I can see both the Whitney Museum of American Art and the High Line from my starting point. Both are relatively new, but are extremely large tourist attractions. Even on a Monday morning, I can see people drifting along the High Line, snapping pictures of the streets below. The way the architecture of the two work together is a good representation of this area as a whole and how it has gotten rebuilt. It displays a mix of modern styles. The Whitney is built mostly of glass and has an interesting patio structure that creates interesting shapes from a distance. I’ve been to this museum several times — for class, for personal enjoyment, with family. On the outside patio they’ll sometimes have interesting instillations and it always boasts great views of the city.


The High Line used to be a freight rail line, carrying goods to and from Manhattan’s industrial districts. It is now a public park of sorts that runs 1.45 miles long. It is interesting to pay attention to the ways that the past of an area like this one is still present in newer developments. The history that is present in their new forms is what makes these places so fascinating to tourists and New Yorkers alike. As I walk through the area, there are still little details that allude to the area’s past. One boutique has not only kept a painted sign reading “Dave’s Quality Veal” but repainted it. This thirst for history and authenticity within New York motivates businesses as well as artists to tell stories. As I walk past street artists and vendors selling photographs, I notice the photos are advertised as "Old New York" -- famous photographs that have been reprinted and are supposed to represent the essence of the city. New Yorkers and tourists alike love to look at old pictures to remind themselves that the city is always changing. Even mediums like these "bring together the workings of the city" (Kittler 722).


I did my derive on a Monday at around midday, so as I continued through the motions of the derive, I noticed that the area wasn’t very busy. This area comes alive on weekends, when people come to the area to walk around, shop, eat, and at night, party. Being close to the water gives me a sense of distance from the rest of the city that I will soon go back to, especially since there are not many people around.


Following the directions from my cards, I ended up at W 16th St, where the same commercial atmosphere dominated the streets. I pass Tao, then the Dream Hotel, followed by a few other exclusive nightclubs. I have always found it interesting to examine places that function at night during the day. They feel dead in that moment, but promising, like something is waiting to happen. These places contribute to a completely different aspect of New York, one that can't be seen this time of day.


I began to head east and then back down to the more residential West Village area. Here, cute townhouses dominate the quiet streets. I also walk by small but expensive restaurants with well designed menus in the windows. This area has a sense of intimacy and a personality I have always loved. I see this in the detailed architecture and the families passing by.

When I come to these streets, I usually come here for a specific purpose, whether a restaurant or a visit to a friend’s place. It is refreshing to experience this area with no motive or agenda. At times, the quiet, residential streets can seem cold but I find them homey and comforting.


My second derive was slightly different from my first derive as the first time around I was intimidated by the idea of giving myself time to explore — I followed the cards quickly and covered as much ground as I could. This time, I made sure to give myself time to process my surroundings and make more connections. I got a bit lost, in thought and location, but was able to rediscover parts of the city that I have spent a good amount of time in.
