The financial district, which is where my second derive was located, is a part of New York I rarely visit. I used to take the C train down to the Wall Street area during my freshman year, but only to occasionally visit a doctor. I never paid much attention to my surroundings, being preoccupied with my appointments, and wanting to return home as quickly as possible. However, after completing my derive, and consciously paying attention to the details and layout of the area, I’ve come to truly appreciate the Financial District, and the history it contains.

My derive started at Trinity Church, one of the most historic and impressive churches in the city. Admittedly, I did not know much about the church before going, however, I ended up spending half an hour walking around the grounds, looking at the gravestones in the churchyard, and reading up on the building. Walking around, I could truly feel the old, stately aura of the church. The ornate spires of the church itself reached up into the sky, with bells that rang out through the streets of the Financial District, ricocheting off the walls of the new high rises. I learned that the church was started in 1696, organized by a small group of Anglicans. The church was at one time given a land grant by Queen Anne, and that by 1750, “the church decided to construct its first chapel-of-ease for its increasingly far-flung communicants” (History). Today, the church is undergoing even more changes, as “the value of Trinity’s real estate holdings is expected to grow because rezoning much of the church’s land will allow up to 3,200 new residential units” (Otterman). Reading all of this, I was reminded of something Shannon Mattern wrote in Deep Mapping the City, “cities themselves serve to mediate between these various manifestations of intelligence—legal codes and copper cables, inscriptions and imaginaries, algorithms and antennae, public proclamations an system protocols…clay and code, dirt and data, pasts and presents intermingle here” (156). To me, Trinity Church is a perfect example of the new and old, of clay and code, coming together. On the one hand, I was walking around, looking at tombstones from the 1700s, while next to me was a subway stop from which tourists were emerging, taking pictures. Not only that, but, as Shannon Mattern explains in The City is a Medium, cities are networks, with maps of wires, streets, and history (718). If we were to dig underneath the ground of Trinity Church, we would find not only decaying corpses, but wires and lighting systems as well.

After a while, I left the grounds of Trinity Church, and walked further into the unknown of downtown New York. As I strolled around the windy streets, I noticed the names of the streets I was walking on : Dutch, Vesey, John, Thames. These names brought to mind the old fur trading captains of old. These seemed like old names, reminiscent of American’s colonial past. My dad actually wrote a book about the history of fur trading in America, and so I am somewhat familiar with the trading and commercial history of the area, and the importance of it’s shipping history. At the start of the city, it was the hub of commercial trading, shipping, and wealth. The streets themselves, curved, narrow, and hilly, remind me of another shipping city, Boston. I felt as though this area, unlike the organized grids of New York, had built up as time went on, with streets and roads added as necessary. It is interesting that Luc Sante mentions that “Many locations in downtown Manhattan acquired a reputation of somewhat disproportionate scale when New York was a small town; as the city grew, such places tended to grow into their legends” (12). If we are to accept that areas truly live up to the reputations associated with them, I found it fascinating that this area is still associated with trading, wealth, and industry. However, now that takes place on Wall Street, not the docks of the city. I also wondered, if this area used to house the elite and wealthy of New York, did they eventually leave to move uptown, to the comforts of Washington Square Park? What happened to this part of the city then? This is something I would definitely like to research more.

Saturday, the day I completed my derive, was usually windy. I had to hold my hat on top of my head to keep it from blowing into the street. As such, it was hard to notice any sensory details, other than the cold, harsh wind, whipping across my face. However, I did notice that this area is much noisier than the East Village, where I did my last derive. The East Village is mostly residential, while the Financial District seems devoted to business. Everywhere I turned there were beeping horns, buzzing cars, and the sound of metal beams clanking on construction site grounds. It isn’t hard to see why this area is the epicenter for business and stocks, as it is constantly being built up and renovated. It also smelled a bit like trash.

An hour into my thoughtful wandering, and I came across the One World Memorial Center. The building was brimming with visitors and tourists, lining up for the museum, as well as the observatory. There was a small elevated park next to the building, where I sat for a while, looking around the city. In the middle of the park was a large statue. Curious, I walked over to read the plaque, and discovered that the sculpture, which was warped and tarnished, was an original sculpture placed in one of the Twin Towers, and was found among the wreckage. Seeing that somber piece of history was definitely a sobering moment for me, and caused me to pause and reflect on what happened in that spot, less than two decades ago. The memorials, parks, and tributes, it seems, are just another way that this city keeps history alive.

Overall, I loved learning more about this part of New York. I enjoyed traversing it’s confusing one way streets, fighting against the bitter wind, and taking shelter from it by huddling against building walls. While I loved exploring the East Village, it didn’t feel as storied, or as weathered, as the Financial District, with its rich trading history, prominent landmarks, and contemporary tragedy. More than before, I truly understood what Sante meant, when he wrote, “It is a city and it is also a creature , a mentality, a disease, a threat, an electromagnet, a cheap stage set, an accident corridor” (1). With so many layers and people piled up on top of each other, its hard to see the city as anything else, but alive.
